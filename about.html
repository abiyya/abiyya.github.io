	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p>This collection is a group of digital works created in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. The versatility of these programs has allowed me to create pieces using photos, digital drawings, and hand drawn 
elements. My work is a 
collection of love inspired pieces which are harmoniously 
colored. I like to create balance in my pieces with composition, focus on figures, and emphasis on warm colors. The reds, oranges, and 
yellows that I use in all of my pieces are the highlight that draws in attention and gives the viewerâ€™s eyes something to explore. My work becomes 
imaginative and expressive through the feeling and thought that I put into it. The result is a lucid and often dreamy set of works which is both dynamic and meaningful. </p>
